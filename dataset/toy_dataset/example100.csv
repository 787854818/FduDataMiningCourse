I will type y, n, or anything and it will go back to the first <code>item_to_buy</code>. I've tried changing the boolean and tried doing the loop without a boolean.

<hr />
<p>A signal with a known velocity, <code>c</code> is emitted by some source. We're given the coordinates of four receivers in three dimensions (<code>[x_i, y_i, z_i]</code>), the time difference of arrival (<code>dT</code>, a.k.a the 'time offset'), and the velocity of the signal, <code>c</code>.</p>
<p>The equation for multilateration is of the form:</p>
<p><code>sqrt( (x-x_i)^2 + (y-y_i)^2 + (z-z_i)^2 ) - c * dT = d_i</code></p>
<p>Where <code>[x,y,z]</code> are the coordinates of the source, which we want to determine.</p>
<p><strong>The answerer describes the following solution:</strong></p>
<p>&quot;To illustrate the method in it's simplest form lets take the 2D problem without the timing offset as an example. We have the equations:&quot;</p>
<p><code>sqrt( (x-x_1)^2 + (y-y_1)^2 ) = d_1</code></p>
<p><code>sqrt( (x-x_2)^2 + (y-y_2)^2 ) = d_2</code></p>
<p>Where <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are the unknowns. To solve this using Newton's method, we rephrase it in the form <code>F(x,y) = 0</code> for some function <code>F</code>. A natural choice to take is <code>F(x,y) = (f_1(x,y), f_2(x,y))</code> where:</p>
<p><code>f_1(x,y) = sqrt( ( x-x_1)^2 + (y-y_1)^2 ) - d_1</code></p>
<p><code>f_2(x,y) = sqrt( ( x-x_2)^2 + (y-y_2)^2 ) - d_2</code></p>
<p>...we can find a new solution by iterating the recurrence:</p>
<p><code>J(r_n)(r_n+1 - r_n) = -F(r_n)</code></p>
<p>where <code>J</code> is the Jacobian matrix and <code>r_n = (x_n, y_n)</code>. As opposed to Newton's method in 1D we need to solve a linear equation system <code>Ax = b</code> at every step to find the new solution.</p>
<p><strong>And provides the following code:</strong></p>
<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>(* Desired solution *)
xx = 2.4; yy = 4.2;

(* Constants *)
x1 = 0.5; x2 = 2.4; y1 = 0; y2 = -1.3;
d1 = Sqrt[(xx - x1)^2 + (yy - y1)^2];
d2 = Sqrt[(xx - x2)^2 + (yy - y2)^2];

(* F = 0 function *)
f1[x_, y_] = Sqrt[(x - x1)^2 + (y - y1)^2] - d1;
f2[x_, y_] = Sqrt[(x - x2)^2 + (y - y2)^2] - d2;

(* Jacobian matrix *)
J[x_, y_] = {{D[f1[x, y], x], D[f1[x, y], y]}, {D[f2[x, y], x], D[f2[x, y], y]}};

Looking for possible solutions on the web, I have found the the error might be caused by a missing text.strip. I tried it but it has not fixed my issue.

<p>Summary: It's possible that clients with spotty connections are causing this issue due to an interrupted connection or that something is killing the Apache child worker process.</p>
<p>Most of the clients calling this API are Android and iOS clients uploading IoT data, so one hypothesis I have is that clients are attempting to upload a large amount of data and are timing out. However, it's frustrating that there isn't a more descriptive stack trace other than 'OSError: Failed to write data'.</p>
<p>I'm currently in the process of figuring out how to increase the timeout on my servers (and scaling up to avoid any performance issues) to see if that hypothesis holds.</p>
<p>But rather than trial and error, is there a better strategy for root causing the issue here?</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<ol>
<li>What other log files should I be looking into?</li>
<li>How would I go about printing the full stack trace to further root cause this?</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm relatively new at Flask/Django/mod_wsgi, so it's a possibility that I'm missing something really obvious here.</p>

<p>I read the CIE L.A.B is the best color space because it isn't affected by hardware (like camera or monitor), so I think it's the best option to compare tones of white (please correct me if I wrong)</p>
<p>For the first time, I used some squared images of the white tones and calculated the alpha against the pre-determined tone of white to classify it according to classification of whiteness. My problem started when I started to use a real cotton's image.</p>
<p>I applied a mask to filter the range of white tones I want to classify, but the rest of the image (what isn't caught by the mask) turns black pixels, and those black pixels interferes on my color check.</p>
<p>I tried many things: ignore the black pixels, reshape the image (turn the cotton image to spread all the image's area) without any success.I tried too calculate the center of the image, or draw a square to get some area of cotton's image to cut and analise just it,  but I realized I need all the cotton surface to be analyzed.</p>

<p>For each row position <code>i</code>, I want to do a rolling sum of <code>col_to_roll</code> between indexes <code>i-7</code> and <code>i-4</code> (both included). The caveat is that I want the values &quot;farther in the past&quot; to be counted more, depending on the column <code>max_duration</code> (which tells for how many timesteps in the future that value can still have an effect).<br />
There's a higher bound which is the remaining timesteps to be counted (min 1, max 4). So if I'm on row number 7 doing the roll-up sum : the value on row number 1 will be counted <code>min(max_duration[1],4)</code> ,  the value on row number will be counted <code>min(max_duration[2],3)</code> etc ...</p>
<p>I could do it the brute force way :</p>
<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>new_col = []
for i in range(7,len(ex)) : 
    rolled_val = sum([ex.iloc[j].col_to_roll*min(ex.iloc[j].max_duration , i-j+1-4) \
                     for j in range(i-7,i-3)])
    new_col.append(rolled_val)
ex['rolled_col'] = [np.nan]*7+new_col

64840794,1,,,2020-11-15 02:54:59,,0,8,"<p>I was having some fun time studying MRO and multiple inheritance in Python, when I came across a question that I have tried to solve without success.</p>
<p>My question is when you use <code>super()</code> and <code>__init__</code> having multiple inheritance.</p>
<p>If I'm having something like this:</p>
<pre><code>class A():
    def __init__(self):
        print(&quot;I'm A&quot;)

class B(A):
    def __init__(self):
        print(&quot;I'm B&quot;)
    

class C():
    def __init__(self):
        print(&quot;I'm C&quot;)

class D(B, C):
    def __init__(self):
        super(D,self).__init__()

d = D()
print(D.__mro__)
</code></pre>
<p>The output is:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm B
(&lt;class '__main__.D'&gt;, &lt;class '__main__.B'&gt;, &lt;class '__main__.A'&gt;, &lt;class '__main__.C'&gt;, &lt;class 'object'&gt;)
</code></pre>
<p>However, changing <code>super(D,self).__init__()</code> to <code>super(B,self).__init__()</code> I get <code>&quot;I'm A&quot;</code>. I understand that MRO looks the next class stated in <code>super(&lt;class&gt;,self)</code>, so if I put <code>super(B,self).__init__()</code>, it makes sense that it will go to class <code>A</code> and print <code>&quot;I'm A&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>So up to this point I'm ok. My question is how can I make this print <code>&quot;I'm C&quot;</code>? Because I cannot run <code>super(A,self).__init__()</code>, since <code>D</code> does not directly inherits <code>A</code>.</p>

<p>Their latest version of the SDK is 06.03 and is pinned against Yocto Thud distributions (which are a bit old now). I've got everything I need setup, have my new BSP, can build everything I need to, but there is exactly one thing I need that I can't get working. The SDK comes with Python 3.5, and I need Python 3.6+ to run a certain tool.</p>
<p>Strictly as an experiment, I've built Docker into the system, and I can run newer containers in there - but that comes with a non-trivial size and performance impact, as well as some additional deployment and upgrade considerations.</p>
<p>I'm trying to figure out if there is a way for me to upgrade only the Python distribution, but I can't seem to find much information about that. There are some notes around about sequentially applying all the patches from later distributions, and trying to compile, debug, etc, but there are a lot of patches and it would be easy to miss something.</p>
<p>I do know one option is to throw away the SDK and go straight Yocto Dunfell, but the Processor SDK comes with a lot of kernel and u-boot tweaks baked in - so I'd like to stick with that in the short term (long, long term plan is to move to straight Yocto and get the latest/greatest).</p>
<p>TLDR; Is there any simple/streamlined mechanism to upgrade Yocto Thud to Python3.6+ without too much risk in finding and applying kernel and rfs patches, or using Docker inside of the rootfs, or moving away from the Processor SDK?</p>

I need to create a program with a loop that will accept integers from the user and then show their sum.However, the input must be completed using a combination (cntr+z or cntl+d depending on the system).Also, the program should check if these are integers, if it should give an error, then the result and exit.And yet I do not understand how I can make the input end with pressing cntr+z or ctrl+d.Please help me figure it out.
Here is my code :</p>
<pre><code>    number = 0
    sum = 0
    while True:
        try:
            listnum = input('Input numbers or press Enter to quit and get total sum: ')

So to preface a little, I am just looking for a simple solution to run full text searches on an SQL database (at this point I don't have a preference for which SQL database). And while researching I found out that SQLalchemy only supports full text searches on postgreSQL, which I have considered using but want to explore all my options. So after some more googling I found whooshalchemy that provides full text search capabilities on mySQL databases, and upon reading more about it I found it refrencing a &quot;WHOOSH_BASE&quot; and a &quot;Whoosh Index&quot;. This was vey confusing, as in all the examples the &quot;WHOOSH_BASE&quot; was just whoosh and no further explanation was given on its purpose. I am very confused what this &quot;WHOOSH_BASE&quot; is used for. Given the use of the word &quot;Whoosh Index&quot; I figured that it had to actually index the searchable fields or something along those lines.</p>
<p>Now this is where I may start to sound stupid, I honestly have no idea what a Whoosh Index is and have been unable to find out anything useful about it. My concern is that the Whoosh Index is making searchable copies of the database's rows, which in my mind means I'm storing twice the data I should be.</p>
<p>So all I need to really know is the purpose of the Whoosh Base and if using a Whoosh Base means I'm storing data twice.</p>
